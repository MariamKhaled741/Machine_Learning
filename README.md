 Assignment 1: Movie Revenue Prediction
Goal: Predict movie revenue and classify success.
Insight: Strong correlation between budget and revenue (r = 0.74).
Models:
Linear Regression: R² = 0.62.
Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 82%, AUC = 0.87.
Key Feature: Budget.

 Assignment 2: Movie Classification with KNN & Random Forest
KNN: Best at K = 9 (Accuracy ≈ 89%).
Random Forest: Accuracy = 97%, but poor recall for successful movies.
Issue: Imbalanced data (only 4% are successful movies).
Suggestions: Use oversampling and better feature engineering.

 Assignment 3: Breast Cancer Classification
Dataset: From sklearn, no missing values.
Classes: 357 benign, 212 malignant.
Preprocessing: Train-test split and scaling.
